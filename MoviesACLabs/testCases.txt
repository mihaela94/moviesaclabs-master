Functional testing:

Test all CRUD operations for both Airlines and Planes.
Examples: 
	try to delete plane/airline with nonexistent ID; 
	try to update plane/airline that does not exist;
	if some attributes are required, try to submit requests with null values corresponding to that fields;
	if some attributes require a certain type of data, try to input data of a different type (e.g. string instead of Date);
